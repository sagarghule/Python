This program contains one class named as Circle.   
Circle class contains three instance variables as 
Radius,Area,Circumference.   
That class contains one class variable as PI which is initialise to  3.14.   
Inside init method initialised all instance variables.   
There are three instance methods inside class as  
Accept,CalculateArea,CalculateCircumference,Display. 
Accept method will accept value of Radius from user. 
CalculateArea method will calculate area of circle and store it into instance variable Area. 
CalculateCircumference method will calculate circumference of circle and store it into instance variable Circumference. 
Display method will display value of all the instance variables as Radius,Area,Circumference.
