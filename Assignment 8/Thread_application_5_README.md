This python application contains two threads named as thread1 and thread2.
Thread1 display 1 to 50 on screen and thread2 display 50 to 1 in reverse order on
screen.
But here at a time only one thread runs.
After execution of thread1 gets completed then schedule thread2.
Here we used lock method to do so.
